# Hello, I'm Jeevan Dhakal. 👋
I am a passionate backend developer. I'm embarking on an exciting journey of exploring the world of data science while refining my skills as a developer.

My expertise lies in developing full-stack web applications with Django, building robust REST APIs using Django Rest Framework, and crafting efficient GraphQL APIs with GQLgen in Golang. I'm no stranger to the world of web scraping, leveraging Python to extract meaningful insights from the web.

Proficient in Docker, I'm skilled in containerization and orchestrating applications for smooth deployment and scaling. I'm also well-versed in modern software development practices. I've mastered the art of GitHub CI/CD, ensuring seamless integration and deployment. My database expertise spans PostgreSQL and MySQL, enabling me to design scalable and high-performance systems.

My curiosity has led me to explore the realm of data analysis. I'm actively honing my data analysis skills and applying them through insightful projects. From data cleaning to visualization, I'm dedicated to turning raw data into meaningful narratives.

In conclusion, my journey as a backend developer and my fervor for data science converge to offer a unique blend of skills and insights. I'm eager to contribute to innovative projects that harness the power of technology and data to drive impactful solutions. I look forward to connecting with fellow professionals to explore the realms where technology and data intersect for transformative results.
